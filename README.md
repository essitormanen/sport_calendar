Welcome to my project "Sport Calendar"!


in routes, event/_sportname doesn't work 

you can fetch events by id 

you can post a new event with a body:
{
  "date": "", //format: yyyy-mm-dd
  "time": "11:00:00", //format hh:mm:ss
  "_sportname": "Football", //VARCHAR
  "_venuename": "Stadium", //VARCHAR
  "_teamname_A": "Huuhkajat", //VARCHAR
  "_teamname_B": "Kurenpojat" //VARCHAR 
}
